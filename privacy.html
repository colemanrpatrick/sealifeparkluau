      <h1>privacy policy</h1></br/>

      <p>This Privay Policy describes our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of information about you in connection with your use of our services, including those offered through our websites, emails, and mobile applications (collectively, the &quot;Service&quot;). The terms &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, and &quot;Site&quot; refer to <b>Ka Moana Luau</span>, a Hawaii corporation with its headquarters in Honolulu, Hawaii. When you use the Service, you consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p><br/>

      <h3>Information We Collect</h3><br/>
      <p>We may collect and store information about you in connection with your use of the Service, including any information you transmit to or through the Service. We use that information to provide the Service&rsquo;s functionality, fulfill your requests, improve the Service&rsquo;s quality, engage in research and analysis relating to the Service, personalize your experience, track usage of the Service, provide feedback to third party businesses that are listed on the Service, display relevant advertising, market the Service, provide customer support, message you, back up our systems, allow for disaster recovery, enhance the security of the Service, and comply with legal obligations. Even when we do not retain such information, it still must be transmitted to our servers initially and stored long enough to process.</p><br/>
      <b>Account Information:</b> If you purchase through our Service, we may store and use the information you provide during that process, such as your full name, email address, zip code, physical address, and other information you may provide with your accounts, such as your age, gender, phone number, and birth date.</p><br/>
      <p><b> Public Content:</b>Your contributions and reviews as provided by third parties such as Yelp, Trip Advisor and Facebook are intended for public consumption and are therefore viewable by the public, including your photos, ratings, reviews, tips, lists, collections, compliments. Your associated account profiles (e.g., first name, last initial, city, neighborhood, month joined, profile photos, and friends) are also intended for public consumption, as is some of your other activities provided by those third parties. This activity could as a result appear on this Site. This interaction can be limited in accordance with the account settings related to those third parties.</p><br/>
      <p><b> Communications: </b>  When you sign up or purchase through this Site, you are opting to receive messages from us and companies associated directly with us. You can request to be removed from our lists in each email sent to you, but note that you cannot opt-out of receiving certain administrative, transactional, or legal messages from us. For example, if you make a reservation, ask us a question about our services, we may send you messages about your transaction using the contact information you provide, including through automated SMS text messages to your phone number. We may also track your actions in response to the messages you receive from us or through the Service, such as whether you deleted, opened, or forwarded such messages. If you exchange messages with others through the Service, we may store them in order to process and deliver them, allow you to manage them, and we may review and disclose them in connection with investigations related to use of the Service, as well as our efforts to improve the Service. We may not deliver messages that we believe are objectionable, such as spam messages, fraudulent solicitations, or requests to exchange reviews for compensation. If you send or receive messages through the Service via SMS text message, forms, or chat fields, we may log information such as phone numbers, phone carriers, and the date and time that the messages were processed. Carriers may charge recipients for texts that they receive. We may also store information that you provide through communications to us, including phone calls, letters, emails, and other electronic messages, or in person.</span></span></span></p><br/>

      <p><b>Transactions</b>If you initiate a transaction through the Service, such as a reservation or purchase, we may collect and store information about you, such as your name, phone number, address, email, and payment information (such as a credit card number and expiration date), as well as any other information you provide to us, in order to process your transaction, send communications about them to you, and populate forms for future transactions. This information may be shared with third parties, and third parties may share such information with us, for the same purposes. When you submit credit card numbers, we encrypt that information using industry-standard technology.</p><br/>


      <p><b> Activity: </b>  We may store information about your use of the Service, such as your search activity, the pages you view, the date and time of your visit, businesses you call using our mobile applications, and reservations and purchases you make through the Service. We also may store information that your computer or mobile device may provide to us in connection with your use of the Service, such as your browser type, type of computer or mobile device, browser language, IP address, WiFi information such as SSID, mobile carrier, phone number, unique device identifier, advertising identifier, location (including geolocation, beacon-based location, and GPS location), and requested and referring URLs. We may also receive and store your location whenever our mobile applications are running, including when running in the background, if you enable our mobile apps to access such information in the course of using the Service. You may be able to limit or disallow our use of certain location data through your device or browser settings, for example by adjusting the &quot;Location Services&quot; settings for our browser, or device settings.</span></span></span></p><br/>

      <p><b>Different Devices:</b>You may access the Service through different devices (e.g., your mobile phone or desktop computer) and different platforms. The information that we collect and store through those different uses may be cross-referenced and combined.</p><br/>

    <h3>Cookies</h3><br/>
    <p>We, and third parties with whom we partner, may use cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, local shared objects such as HTML5 and Flash (sometimes called &quot;flash cookies&quot;), advertising identifiers (including mobile identifiers such as Apple&rsquo;s IDFA or Google&rsquo;s Advertising ID) and similar technology (&quot;Cookies&quot;) in connection with your use of the Service, third party websites, and mobile applications. Cookies may have unique identifiers, and reside, among other places, on your computer or mobile device, in emails we send to you, and on our web pages. Cookies may transmit information about you and your use of the Service, such as your browser type, search preferences, IP address, data relating to advertisements that have been displayed to you or that you have clicked on, and the date and time of your use. Cookies may be persistent or stored only during an individual session.</p><br/>


      <p><b>The purposes for which we use Cookies in the Service include:</b>

        <ul>
      <p>
      <li>
      <p><b>Processes: </b>Intended to make the Service work in the way you expect. For example, we may use a Cookie that tells us whether you have already purchased from us.</span></span></span></p><br/>
      </li>
      </p><br/>
      <p>
      <li>
      <p><b>Authentication, Security, and Compliance: </b>Intended to prevent fraud, protect your data from unauthorized parties, and comply with legal requirements. We use Cookies to determine if you have submitted a request for reservation.</span></span></span></p><br/>
      </li>
      </p><br/>
      <p>
      <li>
      <p><b>Preferences:</b> Intended to remember information about how you prefer the Service to behave and look. For example, we use a Cookie that tells us whether you have declined to allow us to send push notifications to your phone.</span></span></span></p><br/>
      </li>
      </p><br/>

      <p>
      <li>
      <p><b>Notifications:</b> Intended to allow or prevent notices of information or options that we think could improve your use of the Service. For example, we use a Cookie that stops us from showing you a reminder that you have not completed your transaction.</span></span></span></p><br/>
      </li>
      </p><br/>
      <p>
      <li>
      <p><b>Advertising:</b> Intended to make advertising more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers. For example, we may use Cookies to serve you interest-based ads, such as ads that are displayed to you based on your visits to other websites, or to tell us if you have recently clicked on an ad.</span></span></span></p><br/>
      </li>
      </p><br/>

      <p>
      <li>
      <p><b>Analytics:</b> Intended to help us understand how visitors use the Service. For example, we use a Cookie that tells us how our search suggestions in ads and third party search engines correlate to your interactions with the Site.</span></span></span></p><br/>
      </li>
      </p><br/>

      </ul>

      <span style="font-style:italic;">You can set some Cookie preferences through your device or browser settings, but doing so may affect the functionality of the Service. The method for disabling Cookies may vary by device and browser, but can usually be found in your device or browser preferences or security settings. For example, iOS and Android devices each have settings which are designed to limit forms of ad tracking. Please note that changing any of these settings does not prevent the display of certain advertisements to you.</span>
      </p><br/>

      <h3>Third Parties</h3><br/>
      <p><span style="font-style:italic;">Third parties may receive information about you as follows:</span></p><br/>

      <p><b>Advertisers:</b> We may allow third parties to use Cookies through the Service to collect the same type of information for the same purposes as we do. In doing so, we adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance&rsquo;s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. Third parties may be able to associate the information they collect with other information they have about you from other sources. We do not necessarily have access to or control over the Cookies they use, but you may be able to opt out of some of their practices by visiting the following links: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
      <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a> <a href="https://www.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html?omniture=1&popup=1&locale=en_US&second=1&second_has_cookie=0" target="_blank">Omniture</a> <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN" target="_blank">Digital Advertising Alliance</a>.</p><br/>

      <p><span style="font-style:italic;">Please note that opting out does not prevent the display of all advertisements to you. Additionally, we may share non-personally identifiable information from or about you with third parties, such as location data, advertising identifiers, or a cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address) to facilitate the display of targeted advertising. You may be able to limit our sharing of some of this information through your mobile device settings, as described in Section 2 above, or through the Service&rsquo;s settings.</span>
      </p><br/>

      <p><b>Content Partners:</b> We allow third-party partners to use and display some of the public content available through the Service, such as your photos, reviews, and other information detailed in Section 1(b) above.
      </p><br/>

      <p><b> Service Providers: </b>  We may rely on third-party providers to support or provide some of the services that are available through the Service, such as reservations. We may also rely on third party providers to perform certain services for us in connection with your use of the Service, such as communications and hosting services, network security, technical and customer support, tracking and reporting functions, quality assurance testing, payment processing, our own marketing of the Service, and other functions. We may share information from or about you with these third-party providers so that they can perform their services or complete your requests. These third-party providers may share information with us that they obtain from or about you in connection with providing their services or completing your requests. Third-party providers may also share this information with their subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control. Some of our web pages utilize framing techniques to serve content to you from our third-party providers while preserving the look and feel of the Service. In such cases, please note that the information you provide is being provided to the third party.
      </p><br/>

      <p><b> Aggregate or Anonymous Information: </b>  We may share user information in the aggregate with third parties. For example, we may disclose the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, advertisements. We may also disclose anonymized information about your use on the Site, for example, if you engage in a transaction, we may publicly disclose information about the transaction without providing identifying information about you or otherwise disclosing your participation in the transaction.</p><br/>



      <p><b>Business Transfers: </b>  We may share information from or about you with our parent companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control, in which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires the Site, or all or substantially all of our assets, that company will possess the same information and will assume the rights and obligations with respect to that information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p><br/>

      <p><b>Investigations and Legal Disclosures:</b> We may investigate and disclose information from or about you if we have a good faith belief that such investigation or disclosure: (a) is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process and law enforcement instructions and orders, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, judicial proceeding, or other legal process or law enforcement requests served on us; (b) is helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service; or (c) protects our rights, reputation, property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the public, such as disclosures in connection with refund and review validity. If you complain to us through the Service, email, phone, SMS, or review, we may share the substance of your complaint with the related stall, our parent companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control, in pursuit of resolution.
